Andrew's PHP MVC Framework
==========================

Introduction
------------

Hi, I'm Andrew, and this is my PHP MVC Framework. I have a two-week span of 6 free hours every day, and I felt the urge to learn and create. I've been playing in Ruby on Rails for a while, and I missed PHP. CakePHP is nice and all, but I didn't feel like using it. It felt wrong. To that end, I have created this framework, and using time every day to develop it. Don't expect greatness, or stability, or security; this is mostly just me having fun.

Installation
------------

1. Download source and place in a folder
2. Go to app/config.php
3. Edit the base path and style path
4. (optional) If you want (BASIC) model functionality, make sure to put in valid database options. Make sure to create the database and a table with the model's name. Ex: 'Posts_Model' needs a table named 'posts'
5. Look through the documentation, the comments, and the code for usage.

Don't forget to add to the routes.php file if you want more actions.
